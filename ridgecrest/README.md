# Important points to be noted

A lot of paths are hardcoded to Frontera scratch locations. This is done to avoid copying files which do not change across different runs. These need to be changed whenever the server is to be adapted.
The server in github repository are missing the meshes, and relevant ASAGI files as these are too big for github. Contact vikas.kurapati@tum.de in case these are needed.
