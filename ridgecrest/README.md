# Important points to be noted

A lot of paths are hardcoded to Frontera scratch locations. This is done to avoid copying files that do not change across different runs. These need to be changed whenever the server is to be adapted.
The server in the GitHub repository has the meshes and relevant ASAGI files uploaded using GitHub LFS, as these are too big for GitHub. Contact vikas.kurapati@tum.de in case there are issues downloading them from github lfs.
